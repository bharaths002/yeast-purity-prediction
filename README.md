**Yeast Purity Prediction System
**Overview
This project aims to predict the purity of yeast samples used in various industrial applications, such as fermentation processes, by analyzing and processing relevant data. Using a Machine Learning (ML) model trained on historical yeast sample data, the system predicts whether a yeast sample meets the required purity standards. The application is built using the Python Django framework and uses MySQL for database management.

The system allows users to input data related to yeast samples, and it uses a trained machine learning model to predict the purity of the sample based on specific features. This system is designed to help businesses involved in biotechnology or brewing optimize their processes by providing an automated purity prediction tool.

**Features

User-Friendly Web Interface: A simple and intuitive interface to input yeast sample data and get predictions.

Yeast Purity Prediction: The system uses an ML model to predict the purity of yeast samples based on input features such as temperature, pH levels, and other relevant factors.

Database Integration: MySQL is used to store yeast sample data, predictions, and user information.

Django Framework: Built using Python and Django for fast development and scalability.

Model Training: Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) are used for training the prediction model with sample data.

**Technologies Used
Backend: Python, Django

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: MySQL

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for model training)

Libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning model.

Django: For building the backend logic and API.

Installation
Requirements
Python 3.x

MySQL database

Virtual Environment (recommended)

Steps to Set Up
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/yeast-purity-prediction.git
cd yeast-purity-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up MySQL database:

Create a MySQL database and configure your connection in the Django settings (settings.py).

Apply database migrations:


python manage.py migrate
Train the Model:

If the model is not pre-trained, use your dataset to train it:


python train_model.py
Run the application:


python manage.py runserver
Visit the web interface at http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

How It Works
User Input: The user enters yeast sample data through the web interface, such as temperature, pH levels, and other relevant factors.

Model Prediction: The system passes the input data to a trained machine learning model, which predicts whether the yeast sample has the required purity.

Database Storage: The prediction result is stored in a MySQL database along with the yeast sample data for future reference or analysis.

Web Interface: The user receives a prediction and can view details on past predictions via a simple dashboard.

**Future Enhancements
Real-time Data Processing: Integrate real-time data collection from sensors (e.g., temperature, pH sensors) for automatic predictions.

Model Improvement: Enhance the model by incorporating more features and using advanced algorithms (e.g., deep learning).

User Authentication: Add authentication features to allow users to register, login, and save their results.

Dashboard Enhancements: Improve the web dashboard to display more detailed analytics about yeast purity trends.
